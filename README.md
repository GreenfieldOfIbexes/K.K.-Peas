## Overview:

![alt text](./dist/assets/overview_module.gif)

The overview module provides an attractive UX that inspires interest, and an intuitive UI to make conversion seamless.

- With the exception of the social share buttons, all code was written in-house
- Special attention was paid to the carousel, which supports several navigation styles and zooming in/out

## Questions And Answers:

The questions and answers module extends the ability to view and search questions, ask questions, answer questions and provide feedback on questions about the current product.

- All code for this component was written in-house as well, with the exception of the "add question", and "add answer" pop-up modal.

#### Filesystem

All client code is in the **src** directory, where we decided to split the work in four subdirectories, **actions**, **reducers** and **containers** for the Redux part, and **components** for React, to separate concerns.
We agreed that it would be best to keep the Redux _store_ and React _index_ files in the root src directory.
The **components**, and **containers** are split even farther with a directory for each separate widget.
We decided to structure our widget components individually, with the consensus that each component would have it's own CSS file.

This structure allows for easy efficient navigation between files, and avoidance of conflicts.

    /src
      |--actions
      | |--actionName.js
      |--components
      | |--widgetName
      | | |--componentName
      | | |  |--componentName.jsx
      | | |  |--componentName.css
      | |--reducers
      | |  |--reducerName.js
      | |--containers
      | |  |--containerName.js
      |--index.js
      |--store.js
